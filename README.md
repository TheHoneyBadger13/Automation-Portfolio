# Automation-Porfolio
Hi, This is my own automation testing project created to both highlight my automation skills and also to improve it. At this time around I would be using Playwright using Js and using saucedemo test site

Currently has:
1. BDD and non-BDD tests
2. Report generation for both kinds of tests
3. Github actions workflows:
• Continuous Integration (CI) workflow triggered on push
• Scheduled cron job that runs the bdd tests daily
•
